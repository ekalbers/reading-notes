# Testing and Modules

### Today's material is about recursion and testing. Recursion is a very powerful technique of having a method call itself. Testing is gives us the ability to easily test our code with specific test cases.

## Readings
### [In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932)
- Test Driven Development basically means that you write tests for your code before you write the actual code. So if you know you want your code to do a specific thing, you write tests to ensure the code does that and then develop your code to pass those tests.

### [If name equals main](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/)
- This reading just explains why we have the `if __name__ = '__main__':` statement in our python files. It is used to control how the code within the file is run when imported to another file vs running the file directly.

### [Recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)
- Recursion mean calling a function inside of intself. This is very useful for different types of search methods or doing certain math equations.

### Things I want to know more about:
- Everything covered today seems to make sense, I have worked with recursive functions quite a bit in the past and it was very challenging so I am excited to get back into it and see what we can do with recursive functions
