# Class 04

## Why important?
- Classes and objects are an important theme throughout almost all languages so it is important for us to learn how they work in python. Recursion is a very powerful tool and learning how recursive functions work and how to most optimally apply recursive functions is important. Testing is a less sexy topic but is extremely important and being able to design good tests with optimal coverage is important.

### Reading

#### [Classes and Objects](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects)
- Classes and objects in python are very similar to any other programming language, you create a class with methods and then when you create an instance of that class you can access the methods.
#### [Thinking Recursively](https://realpython.com/python-thinking-recursively/)
- You can use a global variable to help track data through recursive funcitons. This is something I had now considered but I would imageine it would be very helpful.
#### [Pytest Fixtures and Coverage](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/python-testing-pytest-fixtures-and-coverage)
- Two big things that are helpful when testing, Fixtures which help provide data for pytest to use throughout tests and coverage which basically just is a question of how thoroughly code has been tested. Luckily there are tools for helping determine coverage of testing.

#### Things I would like to know more about: I think the idea of recursive functions is incredibly cool and thinking my way through is very interesting. My question though is how do you decide when it is best to do a function recursively vs interatively?
