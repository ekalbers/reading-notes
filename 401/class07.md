## Reading Questions
1. Global variables are defined outside of any function or class and are accessible throughout the program. Local variables are defined within a function or class and are only available inside of those functions and classes
2. Global allows you to establish a global variable inside a function and non local allows you to change a variable that was not defined in the function where you are trying to change it.
3. Big O notation is important because it can help you decide what algorithm to use in a particular instance. for Example in the fibonacci sequence function, you could do it iteratively or recursively and bigO can help you decide which is best for your needs.
4. use random module to .randint(1,6) then use that to get any large number of rolled dice. after ever roll add to a counter if a 6 is returned and after all the rolls dived the counter by the however many rolls you did. Number should come out to approximately 1/6
