# React and Forms

## Readings
### [React Docs - Forms]([https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html))
1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  - a component that is controlled by the react state.
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
  - as soon as they enter them so it updates the value in the input
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  - By accessing the value property of the event targeted.

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);

  console.log(false);
}
~~~
  - answer
