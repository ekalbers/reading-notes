2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
  - I think engaged collaboration and learning from other students kind of goes hand in hand, it is very beneficial to be able to see how somebody else think differently from you to help you grow and think of other ways to do things. A collaborative effort also helps you get the best ideas from two people.
3. How does pair programming work?
  - Pair programming helps to foster multiple skills that directly translate to a work environment.
