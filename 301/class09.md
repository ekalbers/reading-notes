# Functional Programming

### Summary of Why Reading are Relevant

## Readings
### [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
1. What is functional programming?
> Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
> It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
> It does not cause any observable side effects
  - copied from reading
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
  - The code is easier to test
4. What is immutability?
  - data in which it's state cannot change after being created
5. What is Referential transparency?
  - when a function consistently yeilds the same result for the same input
